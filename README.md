## Overview üì¢

SubWatcher was created to address a common challenge: many users pay for subscriptions that include valuable features or benefits, yet they rarely take full advantage of them. Whether it's a streaming service, a cloud storage plan, or even niche subscriptions like ChatGPT's Sora video generation feature, SubWatcher keeps track of your usage and sends you a reminder at the end of your subscription period. This ensures you can enjoy every benefit before your subscription renews for the next month.

For example: Many ChatGPT subscribers pay $20/month for a service packed with features‚Äîsuch as Sora‚Äôs AI video generation‚Äîyet they rarely tap into its full potential.  
- **ChatGPT Plus:** Offers credits to create up to 50 priority 5-second videos at 720p  
- **ChatGPT Pro:** Provides up to 500 priority 20-second videos at 1080p (with unlimited "slow" generations)

  - **iOS:** *(Coming Soon)* Will be developed using Swift and SwiftUI for a native mobile experience.
- **Backend:**  
  - A RESTful API (using Python or Node.js) that manages user data, subscription details, and AI analytics.
- **AI Module:**  
  - Implements machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) to analyze usage patterns and extract text from screenshots (the **Identifier**).
- **Database:**  
  - A lightweight relational (e.g., SQLite) or NoSQL database to store user configurations and usage statistics.
